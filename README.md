# Flixify Movie Client

[Visit the project here](https://movies-client-one.vercel.app/)
Discover popular movies and get information about any movie you're interested in.

This client is developed using React, TypeScript, Tailwind and an Apollo GraphQL Client

I used this [React TypeScript](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react) resource for typing react hooks / components
[IMDB API docs](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation)
[GraphQL Server Playground](https://movieql.netlify.app/graphql)

### Possible improvements

- The MovieDetails grid component will be made from scratch, starting from the XS view and up and including as much movie information as possible for each view while maintaining proper dimensions.
- The Flixify header will be removed when in the MovieDetails section (exclusively on XS view)
- Transitions and animations will be implemented in XS view when the user clicks movie for details, clicks for favorites, among others.

### Note to Reviewer
* I didn't understand the sentence in the challenge document "The web app needs to show the highlighted lists with a menu bar to access in the favorites list section." If this is something you're specifically looking for, let me know and we can have a meeting to clarify.
